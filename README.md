## Theoretical description and explanation
Parking sensors are used to determine distance of a driven vehicle from an obstacle. It helps the driver to safely park the vehicle in a constraint spaces. The implementations vary depending on the manufacturer. Some just use beeping as a hint of approaching of an obstacle, other use graphical visualisation, the most modern use cameras to visualize space around the vehicle.

The solution we use to measure distance is using an ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04, processing the signal and hinting the distance on Nexys A7 50T. <br>
